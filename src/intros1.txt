It would be lovely to have high resolution scans of every armorial that was ever created, and for those to be widely available. Sadly, that is not the case. Here are a few electronic versions of some armorials. Some of them are high resolution depictions of the original emblazons, some are modern hand re-drawings or computer graphics and some are the blazons only.
This is the start of a very project. Corrections, notifications of dead links and additions are welcome.



This is a collection of definitions used to describe various types of tenure. Tenure, in this case, being the mechanism by which one person, a vassal, held a piece of property of another person, an overlord. This very simplified definition includes the tenancy of real property or a privilege or the right to use some property of the overlord. These definitions are in many cases cribbed from Wikipedia.
