	This is a collection of definitions used to describe various types of tenure. Tenure, in this case, being the mechanism by which one person, a vassal, held a piece of property of another person, an overlord. This very simplified definition includes the tenancy of real property or a privilege or the right to use some property of the overlord. These definitions are in many cases cribbed from Wikipedia.
